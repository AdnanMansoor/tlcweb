* Remove all reference & dependencies of $is_logged_in variable from "views/events_register.php". Unauthorized access is already blocked from the controller.
* Add placeholder for validation errors in "events_register.php". Error variable is identified by $validation_errors. If it exists you should print it out.
* Remove all links to "Create Thread" & "Create Event"
* Show 'Account Settings' link to logged in users on the main page. The link should point to "members/"
* Remove all references & dependence of $is_logged_in from member_cp.php. The Members controller is protected by default, and can not be accessed by anyone who is not authenticated.
* I've removed the variable $is_logged_in from edit_profile.php. Remove all references and dependencies.
